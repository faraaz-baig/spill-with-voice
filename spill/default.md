Welcome to Spill :)

Please read this guide. It's 5 minutes max.

We built this app.

freewriting is a technique from 1973 where you write continuously for a set time without stopping, editing, or caring about grammar. Pure stream of consciousness. 

This is not a journaling app or a note-taking app.
If you use it for that, you'll open it twice and forget it exists.

This is a tool purely for freewriting — for unclogging your mental drain.

Once you're done, the next step is to click on the "Reflect" button. A soothing voice helps you articulate and make connections in your thoughts you'd never noticed before.

How it works:

1. Think of something that's been bouncing around your head (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. Click fullscreen  
3. Start the timer
4. Write. No backspaces. Don't stop.
5. Reflect on your session by speaking your heart out with Spill (click on the 'Reflect' button)

When the timer ends, it fades back in. You're done.

The rules (non-negotiable):

- No backspaces — truly enforce this by using the strict mode (padlock on the utility bar).
- No spell-checks
- Brief 5-10 second pauses are fine, but keep your fingers moving
- Let your mind wander, you might start writing about work stress and end up processing your relationship with your dad
- No judgment

It’s like your brain is GPT and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you’ll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

If you're new to this:

15 minutes sounds terrifying. "What do I even write about?"

Try this tomorrow morning before work. Open the app and spend 15 minutes on: "What am I working on today? Why is that the most important thing for me to focus on?"

Don't stop writing for 15 minutes.

This simple practice could completely change how you approach your days. If you're used to get lost in busy work and email rabbit holes, you might finish this session with clarity about what actually matters, and often completely change your original plan for the better.

(Or it ends up being dumb and useless for you haha. Find out for yourself!)

Do it for 3 days straight. See what happens.

Other prompts to use:

- “Today, X happened. And it’s got me feeling really down. I think — ”
- “I had a new idea around Z today and want to think through it. Basically — ”
- “I’m in love. And I just wanna talk about it. So — ”
- “I think I wanna pivot some stuff. Here’s how I’m thinking about it — ”

The starting prompt is everything. Spend time choosing it.

Some people are better at processing emotions through writing. Others work through ideas and problems. Try both. Find your groove.

Why this matters:

Freewriting could be a really useful tool.

It might help you think through your most difficult life decisions.
It might help you think through startups in a more thorough way.
It might make you a better partner and friend (communicating with letters is fun).
It might help you be happier (on your down days, you write it all out and feel better).


The app itself:

It looks like nothing — black text, white background, timer. That's intentional.

No spell-check. No markdown. No distractions. Just you and your thoughts.

Bonus features:

1. After a session, click "Reflect." Speak to Spill. AI is surprisingly good at spotting patterns you missed.

2. Scroll on the timer with your trackpad to change duration. Start with 5-10 minutes if 15 feels like too much. We do 25-minute sessions when brainstorming big projects.

3. Font choice affects our thinking. Emotional stuff gets big Arial. Business ideas get clean serif. Use the random button to find your vibe.
